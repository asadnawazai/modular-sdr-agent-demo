# SDR Agent Demo – AI-Powered Cold Outreach Generator

This is a simplified demonstration of an SDR (Sales Development Representative) agent that uses OpenAI GPT-4 to generate personalized cold outreach emails based on lead data.

### 🧠 Purpose

To showcase how AI Intern agents can automate sales outreach using structured lead information and natural language generation. This example simulates how the SDR Agent would function within a larger automation pipeline (e.g., Airtable → GPT → Slack/Gmail).

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

- The script loads a dummy lead record (e.g., job title, company, pain point).
- It then builds a dynamic prompt and sends it to OpenAI's GPT-4.
- GPT-4 returns a personalized outreach email.
- The output is printed to console and saved as sample output.

---

### 📦 Tools Used

- Python
- OpenAI GPT-4 (ChatCompletion API)
- Dummy lead data (JSON structure)

---

### 📂 Files Included

- `sdr_agent_demo.py`: Main script logic for the SDR agent.
- `output.txt`: Sample personalized cold email generated by GPT-4 using the script.

---

### 📝 Output Preview

You can view the generated email in `output.txt`, which reflects how a sales outreach message would be created dynamically from basic lead info.

---

### 🔁 Next Steps (If Extended)

This basic SDR agent can be extended into:
- Airtable integration for lead intake
- n8n/Zapier for automation
- Slack or Gmail for sending messages
- Notion or Airtable CRM for logging replies
